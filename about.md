Hey there! I'm a professional Haskell developer and a software engineer at
[Tweag I/O](https://tweag.io). When I'm not coding or writing about Haskell,
I like listening to music, travelling, and reading.

I've authored a number of [open source projects](/oss.html) and several
[tutorials](/learn-haskell.html). I've also contributed a few chapters for
an upcoming Haskell book called [Intermediate
Haskell](https://intermediatehaskell.com). On this site I collected some
stuff I do for easy access, I hope you'll find something that interests you.

Here are my contacts and social accounts:
